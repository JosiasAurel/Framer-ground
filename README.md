# Framer ground

Elevate your web projects with fine, small animated components.

### How to use?

Simply click on a component, copy the code and paste it into your project.

### Inspiration

My biggest inspiration for creating components comes from looking at [shadcnui](https://ui.shadnc.me) and websites, such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which is fascinating when it comes to user experience.

I would like to thank [Lndev](https://ui.lndev.me), who was a fundamental inspiration for the creation of this project.

### Future plans

I was very excited to develop this project, it's a great pleasure for me to be working on this, I intend to continue and add more and more components and for other like me back then to add micro animations to their website.
