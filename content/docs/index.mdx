## What is Framer ground?

Framer ground is a **free** and **open-source** collection of hand-crafted animations, effects, and interactions that you can seamlessly integrate into your project with a simple copy and paste. The animations are built using TailwindCSS, ReactJS/Nextjs, Framer-motion and TypeScript, and can be easily customized to fit your project's design.

The main aim of me working on this project is basically to learn framer-motion to create more beautiful and simple interactions(animations) that will improve the user experience on my websites and while learning I decided to share them with the world.

We use TailwindCSS for most of the layout, but leave the low-level design details, like colors, font style etc, to you so that you can customize the components to fit your project's design.

## What Framer ground is not

Framer ground is not a full-fledged UI library like Material-UI or Chakra-UI. It is a collection of animations and effects that you can use to enhance your project's design. You can use Framer ground alongside other UI libraries or design systems as well (you will need setup TailwindCSS for this).
