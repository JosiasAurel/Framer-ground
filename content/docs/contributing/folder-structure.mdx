## Core Folders

- `components/`: Contains all the components used across the site.
- `fg/`: Contains all the animations ready and tested to be shipped for production.
- `content/`: Contains the documentation pages.
- `public/`: Contains the static files.
- `app/`: Contains the main Next.js app.
- `app/(hand-crafted)/`: contains pages of testing environment.

You will mostly be working in the `ground` and `content/docs` folders while creating new animations and documentation pages.

## other components

<Callout className="mt-2">
  `Note`: In the components folder, there're other folders like `buttons`,
  `cards`, `carousel`, `forms`, `grid`, `hand-crafted`, `inputs`, `navbar`,
  `scroll`. All these folders are used as testing environment before shipping
  them out to production. So if you have any animation you'll want to create,
  first create a file in one of the corresponding categories above. Then when
  you're done with the file, you can then now copy the code to the `contennt/`
  directory and select same category.
